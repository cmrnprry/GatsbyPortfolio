### About the Game

Date N' Dash is a visual novel about a firefighter named Lyla, who somehow gets stuck in a time loop. Every new loop is slightly different, except for one thing: a cute girl named Gigi.

Date N' Dash was made in a week long game jam after someone posed the question: "What if a dating sim, but everytime you died it got _faster?"_ This led the team to creating a fun, Groundhog Day-esc dating sim. The team managed to finish the game before the end of the jam with a script that was 69 pages long, eleven different music tracks and even some voice acting!

### Contributions

- Collaborated with another writer to design up with overall narrative
- Wrote the narrative for days two, three and parts of five
- Wrote the narrative for two of four possible endings
- Translated the script to work with the Ink Plugin for Unity

### What I Learned

This game was really fun to make! It was my first time in a long time writing a dating sim for a jam. Throughout the whole week, the other writer and I stayed in contact through Discord while we wrote on the same Google Doc. At the start of the jam we had a long call about the structure of the narrative, then divyed up how we were going to write each day of the script, and would leave comments on the other's writing as we went.

It was an interesting way to write, but ended up leaving us with some inconsistancies in writing style. Generally, we both had a similar writing style, but small things like narration style or small character quirks would be inconsistant across the days. We did out best to clean them up, but due to the short time frame of teh jam, weren't able to fix them all.
