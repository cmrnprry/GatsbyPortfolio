### About the Game
This is a horror game about a church that pops up at the end of your street. You don't know where it came from, or how it appeared. Only that it is there now.

This game is a product of a 13 week workshop course. It is not yet finished, but will be hopefully by the end of the year. The game is made entirely in Twine, and will have art and sound by the end. If you wish to play what is currently available, the password for the itch.io page is <u>church</u>.
